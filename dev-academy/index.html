            <h2>The Wisdom of Zoltash</h2>
            <p>
              Wisdom of Zoltash, our tongue-in-cheek fortune-telling app, showcased our first two weeks of bootcamp learning. We utilized Handlebar templates and Express.js to generate dynamic HTML pages, displaying user input alongside relevant fortune-telling content. By employing JSON.parse and
              JSON.stringify, we stored user data and retrieved it for future sessions. Using HTTP methods like POST and GET, we transmitted data to and from the server, providing a seamless user experience. Although we didn't complete the project on time, I continued working on it in my spare time,
              expanding the user experience with additional categories.

            <h2>Know your ASSets</h2>
            <p>
              "Know Your ASSets" was built to apply our new skills in client-side rendering with React (with Typescript), composing UI components, managing component states, and event handling. We created a silly game with farm animals fart sounds and dynamic CSS changes to their semi-transparent
              fart clouds. The game showcased our ability to work together as a team and apply our new skills in an entertaining and playful way. Overall, "Know Your ASSets" was a valuable learning opportunity that helped us hone our development skills while having fun.

            <h2>Buddy</h2>
            <p>
              Our final project involved 7 team members and 6 days. Buddy is an app designed to connect international students with New Zealand locals, providing opportunities to make friends and be introduced to NZ culture. This project gave us the chance to put everything we had learnt over the
              previous eight weeks into action. Our React app needed profiles with CRUD functionality, and a AuthO login setup. Only registered users with profiles have access to seeing other users, and only be able to edit their own profile. Working with a large team proved to be challenging but we
              managed to achieve our MVP and present our project on showcase night.
