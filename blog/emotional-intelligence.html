            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>EQ, or emotional quotient, is a measure of a person's emotional intelligence, or their ability to recognize, understand, and manage their own emotions and the emotions of others. It's not just about measuring the intelligence but also the ability to use emotions to guide thinking and behavior, and to manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>

            <p> IQ, or intelligence quotient, is used to gauge a persons overall intelligence, their cognitive abilities in solving problems and understand complex/abstract ideas and learning.     </p>
                
            <p>IQ doesn't include measuring a persons ability to communicate or function within society (EQ), traits such as empathy, self-awareness, and social skills.</p>                
                

           
            <p>While IQ and EQ are related, they are not the same thing. A person can have a high IQ and a low EQ, or vice versa. Additionally, while IQ is often considered to be relatively stable throughout a person's life, EQ can be developed and improved through training and practice.</p>

            <p>EQ has been found to have more importance than IQ in daily life (personal and professional interactions).There are several ways to improve your emotional quotient (EQ) such as practising mindfulness (improve attention, compassion and empathy), and self-awareness (identify and manage your emotions).</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to me</h2>

            <p>Emotional intelligence is important to me as it helps achieve a healthy work-life balance. By understanding and managing my emotions it's easier for me to set boundaries, manage everyday hurdles, be patient with myself and interact with others, manage stress and generally be a happier, healthier person.</p>
