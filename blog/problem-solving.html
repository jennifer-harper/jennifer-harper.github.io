    Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

    what was the problem?
what problem-solving techniques did you use?
how did you feel throughout the process?
what did you learn?


    <div class="intro">
        <h1>A story about Problem solving</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Chapter One</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was (and still is) a eager and excited fledgling developer named Jen. Sitting at a desk, in a room, a nice room, with lots of sun and good airflow, Jen is looking at her assignment questions. She's feeling confident. She's read the question, worked out the answer (after a bit of research and playing around on RunJS), but the npm test command is not generating the &#x2713; that she needs to move on. She checks here code, repeats her RunJS test, the npm test, reads the error messages, but still no luck. She doesn't understand!  Starting to feel tired and frustrated Jen decides to take a small break (chocolate!) and engages in a a bit of tidying up (exercise) before she returns to the question. She rereads the question. Eureka! She has found the problem. She hasn't read the original question correctly, and hasn't (quiet) achieved the required solution. She tweaks her code and voila, &#x2713; achieved. So non-tech readers, the moral of chapter one is to always carefully read the question!</p>

            <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
            <p>Once again, the story begins at the same place, and at a close point in time to the previous tale. The day is warmer and the sun is shinier, the birds are chirping and the neighbours ware quiet. Jen is feeling happy, it's shaping up to be a good day. She'd discovering RunJS, a great desktop app where you can test and view your code (she'd previously been using inferior and time wasting methods). She's also found some great resources that help her understand JS a bit better. She started to see a wee process that works for her forming. Writing pseudocode, searching for the answers to each step online, then combining and solving the problem as a whole. This process feels rewarding for Jen, even though the answers were not always achieved! Jen founds it a nice methodical process. Although she had not elegantly solved any code yet, the little fledgling has finished her week 4 sprint 1 day early! Feeling excited, she promises herself that tomorrow she'll go back over her code to tidy things up/ find more elegant solutions, maybe even do the extra stretches in older assignments.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
            <p>The toys in her step-sons bedroom watched on with nil interest as Jen clunked away at her old keyboard. They wished she'd go away so they could continue their usual daily activity of hiding socks, pushing crumbs under the bed and resting in the sun. However, the lego pirate captain, on the lego pirate ship, did notice, through her lego binoculars, that Jen seemed very confident (trying) to write pseudocode, trying things out, reading error messages, console.logging and googling solutions. Those seemed to be her go to methods during these hearty sunny days. Pirate Captain was impressed that Jen also used a kind of rubber ducky method, writing lots of explanatory notes to herself. Jen was less inclined to ask coaches and peers for help though, this was more of a last resort kind of solution. She suspected that Jen found these methods slightly frustrating unless they were face to face interactions. Things were much easier to do face to face, like rum drinking! </p>
