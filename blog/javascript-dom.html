        <h1>Javascript and the Dom</h1>
            <b>This blog is a general summary about JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS,
            Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects, Functions and why they are useful, The DOM and DevTools.
        </p>

        <div>
            <p><b>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</b></p>
            
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and other dynamic features to websites. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the content and layout of a website, as well as to create interactive effects, validate forms, and to handle user input events.</p>

            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure the content of a webpage. It is used to define the different elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>

            <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to define the visual presentation of a webpage, such as the layout, colors, and fonts. It is used to separate the presentation of a webpage from its structure and content, which are defined using HTML.</p>

            <p>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are all commonly used together to create dynamic, interactive webpages. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the content and layout of a webpage, defined by HTML, and to change the styles, defined by CSS, in response to user input or other events.</p>
        </div>

        
        <div>
            <p><b>Javascript Control Flow</b></p>
            
            <p>JavaScript control flow refers to the order in which statements in a program are executed, relating to true or false information, conditionals (if/else) and loops (for, while). </p>

            <p>For example, if it is 'true' that you finish your dinner, you can have dessert but if it is 'false' that you finished your dinner (you did not finish) you have to go to bed early</p>
            <code>
                function dessert(you){
                    if(you === 'finished your dinner'){
                        return 'Have some dessert'
                    } else (you === 'still have food on your plate'){
                        return 'Go to bed!'
                    } 
                }
            </code>
            <p>A loop might be used to count how many piece of broccoli you have eaten off your plate and add the equal amount of chocolate to your dessert bowl</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>The DOM and how you interact with it</b></p>
            
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents. It is a standard used by web browsers to understand and display the content of a web page. The DOM allows developers to access and manipulate the elements of a document programmatically, using JavaScript or other programming languages. </p>
            <p>For example you can access a buttons id, using 'document.getElementById(id)', and then change the color of a button when a user clicks on it.</p>
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</b></p>
            
            <p>In JavaScript, arrays and objects are both used to store collections of data. However, the way you access the data stored in them is different.</p>

            <p>Arrays use an index number to access data stored in them. For example, if you have an array called "fruits" and it contains the elements "apple", "banana", and "orange", you can access the "banana" element by calling fruits[1], because arrays are 0-indexed.</p>
                
            <p>Objects, on the other hand, use keys to access data stored in them. For example, if you have an object called "person" and it contains the properties "name" and "age", you can access the value of the "name" property by calling person.name.</p>
            <p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>What is a function? Why they are helpful?</b></p>
            
            <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and returns a result. Functions are helpful because they allow for code to be organized and reused. By defining a function, a programmer can give a name to a specific task, and then call that function by its name whenever that task needs to be performed. This can make code easier to read, understand and maintain. Additionally, the use of functions can make it easier to debug code, as issues can often be isolated to a specific function. Functions can also be used to break down a large program into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>
