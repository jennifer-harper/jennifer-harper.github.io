        <h1>Learning plan</h1>

        <p><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p></b>
        <p>Find creative fulfillment and increase skill set. Be hired as a developer after the course ends. Interested in doing front end development, as a nice mix of design and tech skills.</p>
        
        <p><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</p></b>
        <p>My strengths are good time management, determination and love of learning. 
        I enjoy learning/working by myself as it gives me time to process and practice, but I also understand the value of working as a team, and team dynamic, so I try to be a respectful friendly team member. My limitations included setting unreasonable high standards for myself and being impatient in stressful situations. </p>
        
        <p><b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p></b>
        <p>My presentation skills. I get nervous and babble and usually don’t remember what I’ve actually said!</p>
        
        <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p></b>
        
        <p><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p></b>
        <p>I will make sure I look after myself (work/life balance) and be honest and respectful to anyone else I interact with at Dev Academy.</p>
        
        <p><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</p></b>
        <p>Take a step back from the situation. Take a break. Eat some chocolate.  Seek help. DIscuss any worries or concerns with the appropriate people.</p>
        
        <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p></b>
        <p>I will contact my facilitators in person (where possible) or via Discord before things get out of hand, maybe just to let them know I'm stressed or to work out any possible solutions.</p>
        
        <p><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p></b>
        <p>Help and guidance for problem solving. </p>
        
        <p><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p></b>
        <p>No concrete commitments at this point in time.</p>
