      <h1>Learning plan Bootcamp</h1> 


      <div>
        <h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>I am hoping to use the skills I gain on this course to get employed in a challenging, interesting job. I'd like to make an impact on my personal life. Getting a job with a salary rather than being a poor student would be a great start. I don't have a particular destination in mind but I would like to work for a company where I am generally excited and interested in what they do, their values or their goals.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>I think my biggest limitation will be self confidence in my abilities. I don't like being watched when I do something, so I imagine peer programming will take some getting used to. But my strength in focus and determination will also help me get over this, as I'm excited to learn and become a better developer. I think my strengths and values are still the same. Everything is a work in process though, we learn and adapt to new situations.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>As mentioned previously, I don't like speaking in front of others, or not feeling confident in my knowledge. I've also noticed that I'm not as good as I thought I would be at taking breaks and asking for help, so I'm conscious of trying to be better at those. It's always hard to be kind to yourself in hard/stressful situations, so it's important to continue trying to do that during this time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>I'd like to develop a range of human skills, especially presentation skills and team work skills. I'd also like to become more patient and less stressed, maybe a better listener.</p>
      </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>I love the idea of having a team of people on hand to help me work through problems and teach me new skills. I know that this was available to me during foundations but I much prefer learning/ receiving help with a face to face element. It's much easier to point at a screen or explain something you're not sure how to explain when you don't have to type it or switch between video chat and share screen! But also the same as last time, I expect a team of people to support me and help me learn</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>My expectations of myself on Bootcamp are to use my time to learn as much as possible and have fun while doing it. I'd like to make some great friendships during this time. I think it's important to remain respectful and patient. Clear communication is essential. It is also important to look after yourself, stress and unhappiness can make you do things you regret. So maintaining work/life balance is as important as ever. I will continue to practice mindfulness, exercise, do other creative things and have time with friends and family where I can.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Learning plan Foundations</h2>

        <p><b>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p></b>
        <p>Find creative fulfillment and increase skill set. Be hired as a developer after the course ends. Interested in doing front end development, as a nice mix of design and tech skills.</p>
        
        <p><b>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</p></b>
        <p>My strengths are good time management, determination and love of learning. 
        I enjoy learning/working by myself as it gives me time to process and practice, but I also understand the value of working as a team, and team dynamic, so I try to be a respectful friendly team member. My limitations included setting unreasonable high standards for myself and being impatient in stressful situations. </p>
        
        <p><b>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p></b>
        <p>My presentation skills. I get nervous and babble and usually don’t remember what I’ve actually said!</p>
        
        <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p></b>
        
        <p><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p></b>
        <p>I will make sure I look after myself (work/life balance) and be honest and respectful to anyone else I interact with at Dev Academy.</p>
        
        <p><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.</p></b>
        <p>Take a step back from the situation. Take a break. Eat some chocolate.  Seek help. DIscuss any worries or concerns with the appropriate people.</p>
        
        <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p></b>
        <p>I will contact my facilitators in person (where possible) or via Discord before things get out of hand, maybe just to let them know I'm stressed or to work out any possible solutions.</p>
        
        <p><b>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p></b>
        <p>Help and guidance for problem solving. </p>
        
        <p><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p></b>
        <p>No concrete commitments at this point in time.</p>
