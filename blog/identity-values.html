        <h1>What do I value? What are my strengths?</h1>
        <p><b>I value:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Having a good work life balance</li>
        <li>Being honest - or having the courage to be honest</li>
        <li>My creativity (the satisfaction from building/fixing/making stuff)</li>
        <li>My freedom - being able to make my own decisions.</li>
        <li>Being respected, and being respectful</li>
        <li>My family and friends - the love, strength, and support they give me</li>
        <li>Helping others - kindness brings kindness!</li>
        <li>Small rewards and gratitude for the beautiful things in everyday life.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>My strengths</b></p>
        <p>I love being productive and efficient (perhaps there's some perfectionism mixed in there ðŸ™‚). Iâ€™m a kind and respectful person (at least I try to be), who values social interaction. I care deeply for my friends and family, but I definitely recharge by having my own personal time. I consider myself a strong and assertive person, sometimes I can be shy, but I definitely donâ€™t have a problem standing up for myself!</p>

        <p><b>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</b></p>
        <p>I don't have a major example. I think we make small ethical decisions everyday, whether it's about recycling, or the type of companies we choose to buy from. In general, from an ethical perspective, I think you should always be honest about your actions, even if it could have unwanted consequences. </p>
        <p>In the past, I thought Iâ€™d deleted/broken something major on a project, I was very anxious about telling my manager (as I'd probably look like an idiot). I decided instantly that hiding it would be pointless and the sooner I was honest, the sooner we could fix the issue. Of course there was a fix and everything worked out fine, but what a relief! Iâ€™d hate to have to live with the guilt or lie about the situation. Ripping the bandage off quickly is usually the best solution!</p>

        <p><b>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</b></p>
        <p>I admire honest and respectful people, I donâ€™t have time for bullying or negativity. As Iâ€™ve grown older Iâ€™ve become more aware of the types of people I chose to be friends with. I have a great family and an amazing group of friends who are kind, loving, and supportive of each other. Iâ€™m extremely grateful to have this in my life. This influences how I treat other people, as obviously I want to be treated in the same way!</p>


        <p><b>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</b></p>
        <p>I have (in my opinion) excellent time management skills. I enjoy being organised, and like being proud of my work. I love the reward of problem solving and learning. I usually have good awareness of my stress levels and great appreciation for the benefits of a work life balance. Overtime Iâ€™ve learnt that walking away from a problem and doing physical exercise are great problem solving skills (I've recently become addicted to Squash). Often a solution will make itself visible when you stop thinking about it!</p>


        <p><b>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</b></p>
        <p>I hate public speaking. Iâ€™m ok with impromptu, but tell me I have to give a presentation in the future and I feel sick in my guts! Iâ€™ve worked at getting over this by teaching short courses in the past, and was proud of my achievements, but the fear still lurks inside! This could affect my learning journey as I will try to avoid these situations, and perhaps miss out on opportunities.</p>

        <p> Iâ€™ve seen from playing squash that I can be a terrible winner (but always a good loser) with my friends. I consider myself to be competitive, but usually only with myself, I set very high expectations and often want to achieve perfectionism. This isnâ€™t healthy, but at least Iâ€™m aware of it and try to be kind to myself.</p>


        <p><b>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</b></p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been in teams before where no one was really sure of their role, and the team as a whole lacked leadership and direction. These projects never had the best results.  I think the best teams have clear and honest communication, and everyone feels happy and confident with their position. This was often obvious when we employed a loose Scrum setup. Every morning each member talked about what they were working on, and had the opportunity to ask for any assistance or advice (this was during lockdown, so a nice relaxed team chat while we drank our coffees too). These projects had great results because everyone felt confident and supported.</p>
