    <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I've realized that I don't rush to ask for help. I have the stereotypical kiwi 'fix it yourself' attitude. I've learnt that I love the process of problem solving, and the feeling of reward for figuring it out for yourself. I haven't got to a point where it's ridiculous not to ask for help (thank goodness), but that seems to be the last resort for me.
        I've learnt that routine and consistency are important to my personal life and learning abilities, I achieve more when I feel stable and comfortable.
        I've understood over the last 10 years or so that we should appreciate and learn from failure, but I didn't realize that this was considered an Open Mindset, so I've learnt that I have an open mindset! This attitude has of course developed from age and experience. I wish I had had this mindset when I was younger/starting out at university/starting full time work. Learning with high expectations puts a strain on the process, which of course is just as important as the outcome.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>My values, empathy and self awareness shape the way I learn and process information, by understanding my strengths and weaknesses I can grow as a developer. These qualities give me an 'outside the box' or helpful perspective when I'm struggling, as I can categorize the problem and work through it, rather than self-destruct and give up. Empathy towards myself is great, but it's important to have empathy when working with others, to gain perspective and to also create a harmonious environment for everyone in your daily life.</p>
    </div>    
    
    <div>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h2>
        <p>I cant think of anything to write here, I dont recall being surprised about anything. Its all interesting, but nothing surprising. Im surprised my instagram advertsing feed hasnt picked up on all the mindfulness/neuroplasticity google searches I've made,  yet. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I found it challenging to dedicate time to reflecting on the core exercises, I left it until the last minute as I'd rather be spending my time learning code. I liked learning/researching Open Mindset, Neuroplasticity and Emotional Intelligence, but documenting was hard/tiring. I suppose it's a bit like Twitter, I'd never have a Twitter account as I don't care what people think about what I think, so I don't feel the need to tell everyone! I'd also never personally reread/keep a journal, I find it cringy. Photo diary or drawing journal on the other hand would be something I'd enjoy doing, to document something, but obviously it's not so appropriate for a developer course.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>One major purpose/outcome of this course is to provide students with employment opportunities. It's been repeated throughout the course that employers are more interested in applicants that can work in a team/business environment, communicate with others, and look after their mental health, than coding geniuses (with no social skills). It also opens students' minds to the learning and failure relationship, how to cope with stress, and perhaps prevent future employment burnouts through the knowledge learnt in the core activities.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>I think the core learning is essential, it helped me practice good learning habits and be kind to myself. But, as mentioned above, I do not like writing the reflections.</p>
