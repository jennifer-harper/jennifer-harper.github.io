        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
         <div>
            <h2>What is Neuroplasticity</h2>
           
            <p>It was previously believed that once we reached a certain age, we could no longer change or develop new skills, as in 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'. The brain is actually a highly active and malleable learning machine. Our brains are able to adapt and change in response to situations and experiences (or our behaviour). Through engaging in Neuroplasticity principles in our everyday life, we can proactively improve their brain health and cognitive functions.</p>                 
                
            <p>The more we challenge our mind and body, the longer we can function at a high level. Engaging regularly (or repetitively) in activities such as exercise, mindfulness, rest, social activity, and learning (anything!) are known to promote the formation of new neurons and the strengthening of existing neural connections, improving our overall brain performance. This can lead to improved mood, attention span, physical performance, and general mental health. </p>

            <p>These changes work on chemical, structural and functional levels of the brain. Chemical changes occur at the initial stage of learning something new and influences short-term memory. Structural changes occur when the neurons start to form new connections, changing your brain structure. This takes more effort and repetition and influences long term memory.Functional change occurs when entire brain networks change. These brain networks, as they are used over and over again, become more excitable and more efficient when activated.</p>

            <p>You can improve your neuroplasticity by learning something new, that is significant to you, with shorter bouts of intense repetition. It is important to also be patient with yourself, as these changes take time.</p>

            <p>About 6 years ago I listened to The Brain That Changes Itself by Dr Norman Doidge on audiobook. It was very interesting. There is a great example of a women who felt like she was falling all the time, a sort of vertigo. She cures her problem with a repetitive sensory stimulation. I found all the examples and methods very interesting an quite amazing. I recommend it as a starting book if you're interested in this subject. </p>

            <h2>What is Growth Mindset</h2>

            <p>Growth Mindset, or a Growth Mindset is believing in your existing abilities and potential for growth and development. Growth mindset has a focus on the process of learning, viewing challenges and failures as opportunities for development. Growth mindset promotes resilience and positivity in the face of difficulty, rather than giving up or avoiding conflict. </p>

            <p>I watched Carol Dweckers youTube video, Developing a Growth Mindset, very interesting. Some children who knew they wouldn't be able to solve a problem had complete meltdowns and didn't want to attempt to solve the problem because they knew they would fail (fixed mindset), but Open mindset children were interested in learning about the subject regardless, and would obviously learn from the situation. This was a really enjoyable explanation of the growth mindset, in everyday context. I've put in a loan request at the Library for her book, Mindset, although I'm 20th inline!</p>

            <h2>How are they relative to my learning process</h2>
            <p>Learning about growth mindset has been a nice refresher in this frustrating learning process. I get angry that I don't know the answers, or how to figure out the answers, but of course giving up or not trying will not solve this. Repetitive trying and failing can be tiring though.Part of my mindfulness training or reflection process will be some kind of mantra about learning from failure. My failures will teach me too. Another useful reminder is reaching out and asking for help, I'm here to learn, and be taught, so I should use all resources available to me.</p>
