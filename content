After completing my web developer training at Dev Academy and gaining hands-on experience at Spotzer, I accepted a junior web developer position at Ambitious Aotearoa, a dynamic digital marketing agency on Tory Street. This role allowed me to apply and grow my technical skills while contributing to a variety of projects, collaborating with talented designers, and building solutions that met both client and user needs.

A key part of my role involved collaborating closely with designers to interpret and bring their visions to life. I translated Figma and Adobe designs into responsive, interactive web applications, ensuring the user experience (UX) remained seamless and intuitive. By maintaining open communication, I helped refine designs when necessary and ensured technical feasibility without compromising creative intent.

During this time, I discovered Craft CMS and Craft Commerce — and quickly fell in love with their flexibility and powerful features. Craft CMS is an excellent choice for building highly customizable websites, offering a clean and intuitive user interface for content management. It allows developers to create tailored experiences for clients, providing granular control over both front-end design and back-end functionality. Craft Commerce extends this even further, making it ideal for scalable and personalized eCommerce solutions.

Working with Craft CMS has deepened my understanding of PHP, Twig templating, and efficient content modeling. I've enjoyed creating modular and reusable components, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless user experiences for both site visitors and content managers.

When I wasn’t working with Craft CMS, I built websites using Webflow, taking advantage of its user-friendly CMS to empower clients to manage their own content. For custom projects, I used Bootstrap/Tailwind, and jQuery to create responsive, visually engaging sites. My everyday toolkit also included Figma for design collaboration, the Adobe Suite for graphic work, and GitHub for version control and seamless teamwork.
